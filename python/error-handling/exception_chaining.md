except ctl.Error as e:
            raise ConnectionError(f"Could not connect to Smaract MCS2 at {self.locator}") from e


The `from e` syntax is called **"Exception Chaining"**.

### Reason

It tells Python: "I am raising a new exception (`ConnectionError`), but the **direct cause** of this new exception was another exception that I just caught (`e`). Please link them together in the error message."

It essentially creates a chain of evidence for debugging.

### The Detailed Explanation: The Problem It Solves

Imagine you have layers of code. A low-level library function calls another, which is then called by your high-level code.

1.  **Low-Level (SmarAct Library):** `ctl.Open(locator)` tries to talk to the hardware.
2.  **Your Driver (The Wrapper):** Your `_connect` method calls `ctl.Open`.
3.  **Main Script (The User):** Your main script creates an instance of your `SmaractMCS2` class.

Now, let's say the USB cable is unplugged. The `ctl.Open` function will fail. It knows exactly why it failed (e.g., "USB device not found") and raises a specific `ctl.Error`.

**Scenario 1: WITHOUT `from e`**

```python
# The "bad" way
except ctl.Error as e:
    # We catch the ctl.Error, but then we throw it away
    # and raise a completely new, unrelated ConnectionError.
    raise ConnectionError(f"Could not connect to Smaract MCS2 at {self.locator}")
```

When this code runs, the traceback (the error message) you see will look like this:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "your_script.py", line 123, in <module>
    mirror_mount = SmaractMCS2("usb:sn:12345")
  File "/path/to/smaract_driver.py", line 50, in __init__
    self._connect()
  File "/path/to/smaract_driver.py", line 60, in _connect
    raise ConnectionError(f"Could not connect to Smaract MCS2 at {self.locator}")
ConnectionError: Could not connect to Smaract MCS2 at usb:sn:12345
```

**The problem:** You see your friendly `ConnectionError`, but the original, valuable information from the `ctl.Error` (the message "USB device not found") is **completely gone**. You know the connection failed, but you've lost the crucial clue as to *why*.

**Scenario 2: WITH `from e` (The Pythonic Way)**

```python
# The "good" way
except ctl.Error as e:
    # We catch the ctl.Error and use it as the cause for our new exception.
    raise ConnectionError(f"Could not connect to Smaract MCS2 at {self.locator}") from e
```

Now, the traceback you see will look like this:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/path/to/smaract_driver.py", line 59, in _connect
    self.d_handle = ctl.Open(self.locator)
smaract.ctl.Error: <The original error message from the library, e.g., "USB device not found (error code: 1234)">

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "your_script.py", line 123, in <module>
    mirror_mount = SmaractMCS2("usb:sn:12345")
  File "/path/to/smaract_driver.py", line 50, in __init__
    self._connect()
  File "/path/to/smaract_driver.py", line 61, in _connect
    raise ConnectionError(f"Could not connect to Smaract MCS2 at {self.locator}") from e
ConnectionError: Could not connect to Smaract MCS2 at usb:sn:12345
```
